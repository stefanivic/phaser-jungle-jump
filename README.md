This is an adaptation of the game found in Phaser 3 documentation with improved graphics and a few more updates.
The demo of the game can be found on [this link](https://phaser-jungle-jump.now.sh/)

## Todo
1. Add a loading/welcome screen.
2. Add buttons to start a new game.
3. Add difficulty levels (easy, hard, insane). 

## Using This Project

1. Make a directory somewhere in your file system where you want to keep your project.
1. `cd` into that directory from the command line.
1. Clone this project with `git clone https://github.com/stefanivic/phaser-jungle-jump.git`.

## Installing Dependencies

1. From the cloned project's directory, run `yarn install` or `npm install`.

## Running The Project

Once you've installed the project's dependencies, you can run the project using [Webpack Dev Server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server).

1. From your project's directory, run `npm run start` or `yarn start`.
1. Open up your browser to `http://localhost:8080`.
1. You should see a web page with the game. 
1. :tada:

Because you are running the project through Webpack Dev Server, any time you make a change to your source code, the browser will automatically refresh with your updated code.
